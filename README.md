Case Study Project - Travel Insurance
You are working for a travel insurance company. Due to the COVID pandemic they have had
to make cuts to their marketing budget. It is more important than ever that they advertise in
the right places and to the right people.


They have plenty of data on their current customers as well as people who got quotes but
never bought insurance. They want to know if there are differences in the travel habits
between customers and non-customers - they believe they are more likely to travel often
(buying tickets from frequent flyer miles) and travel abroad. They would be interested in any
other insights you can find that might help the marketing strategy.
Your presentation should be no longer than ten minutes. It should include no more than eight
slides of content. You will be presenting to the CEO.
